## What is a Trustcheck?

Roblox has a check to see if the URL that was inputted is trusted by them or not, this can be bypassed via 2 options
1-) Using the Trustcheck1 / Trustcheck2 address (im sure this is patched)
2-) Using the JNZ address which requires a Memcheck bypass, this is the option that I've released

## Installation

Literally paste the code, and initialize it

## Usage

```
// Initialize your memcheck before initializing your trustcheck bypass
InitializeTrustcheck();
```
